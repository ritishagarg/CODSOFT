# CODSOFT
All the Artificial Intelligence tasks and projects done during the internship with CODSOFT are uploaded here.

Overview of the tasks done:-
## 1. Rule-Based Chatbot 
Developed a Rule-Based Chatbot using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) which deals with NLP(Natural Language Processing) applications, one of the primary applications being Chatbot development. Reps.json file contains the queries and their responses.

## 2. Tic Tac Toe AI
Unleashing the powers of AI in gaming, I developed a Tic Tac Toe game with an unbeatable AI using MINIMAX algorithm. This game has switch modes i.e you can play with a computer or you can switch to play with a human by pressing the space bar. 

## 3. Image Captioning
Image Caption Generator that uses VGG16 (CNN) as the encoder and RNN (Recurrent neural network) as the decoder provides  relevant captions for images. Feature extraction is done using VGG16 and RNN is used as language model to provide captions.

## 4. Recommendation System
A recommendation system built using collaborative filtering methods like SVD(Singular Value Decomposition) that recommends books to users based on their preferences.
